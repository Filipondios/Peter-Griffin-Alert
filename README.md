# Peter-Griffin-Alert
Just a simple "applicattion" that alerts you from Peter Griffin. Its based in a Java application that make the same function, but was created just for a meme. Here  you can see, how I implemented this Peter Griffin Alert with my own code. Its a very short code, very simple, and every line is worth it. The code is located in the folder ``"alert/src/Alert.java"``. Hope you enjoy it.<br>
